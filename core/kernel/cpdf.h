/** CPdf special object.
 *
 * This class is responsible for pdf document maintainance. It provides wrapper
 * on document catalog dictionary with advanced logic concerning revision
 * handling, high level object creation and their synchronization with actual
 * properties state and mode depending operations. Provides interface for making
 * changes to document. In a result it provides fascade for all oparations which
 * have document scope.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Instancing</b><br>
 * Public constructor is not available and instances can be created on by 
 * static factory getInstance method. Also no public destructor is available 
 * because instance returned by getInstance methods is wrapped by shared_ptr
 * smart pointer which keeps instance alive until reference to the pointer
 * exists (this is based on reference counting scheme - see smart_ptr 
 * documentation for more information).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Open mode</b><br>
 * Each document may be open in several modes. Each open mode brings specific
 * handling of document manipulation. Open mode for document is set only in 
 * constructor and can't be changed during CPdf instance life cycle. 
 * @see CPdf::openMode
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Document changes</b><br>
 * CPdf instance contains XRefWriter typed field which maintains all changes to
 * document content. It is not accessible outside from the class to keep full
 * control over instance in CPdf. To enable using also xpdf code outside CPdf
 * CXref casted supertype of XRefWriter is returned in getCXref. This instance
 * doesn't enable any changes but enables access to most accurate indirect
 * objects. Changes to XRefWriter can be done only by CPdf methods. Note that
 * changes can be be done only in newest revision (@see save).
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Document properties</b><br>
 * Properties from document can be accessible from document catalog which is
 * returned by getDictionary method. New indirect property, which may be used in
 * some other property (by its reference) can be created by addIndirectProperty.
 * Change of indirect property can be registered to the XRefWriter by 
 * changeIndirectProperty method.
 * Finaly each indirect property is accessible by getIndirectProperty. All these
 * methods are just some wrappers to XRefWriter internal field with CObject to
 * xpdf Object conversion logic. Using them guaranties that all changes are
 * synchronized correctly.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Pages maintainance</b><br>
 * One of CPdf responsiblities is to keep CPage instances synchronized with
 * current state of page tree. Page instances (CPage typed) can be obtained by
 * getPage, getFirstPage, getLastPage, getNextPage, getPrevPage methods. All
 * returned instances are kept in pageList to guarantee that request for page at
 * same position returns same page instance (unless page tree is changed).
 * CPdf uses several observers to keep this synchronization. Observer classes
 * are inner to this class to have good access to protected and private fields.
 * Each observer is specialized for one type of change in page tree:
 * <ul>
 * <li>PageTreeRootObserver - synchronizes changes which affects page tree root.
 * <li>PageTreeNodeObserver - synchronizes changes which affects Kids array
 * property
 * <li>PageTreeKidsObserver - synchronizes changes which affects Kids array
 * content and elements
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * insertPage and removePage enables inserting and removing new pages to the
 * page tree. This way is prefered for making such changes. Other way (as
 * mentioned above) is to change page tree directly using property interface.
 * This way may lead to errors which are not recoverable (may destroy valid 
 * pdf page tree format) and so it is strongly discouraged unless you exactly
 * know what you are doing and CPdf interface doesn't provide right way how 
 * to do it.
 * <br>
 * Pages are counted from 1 (first page) up to getPageCount return value. Note
 * that this may not represent values used for inner page counting writen on the
 * page. CPdf doesn't handle any kind of special document numbering.
 * <p>
 * <b>Revision manipulation</b><br>
 * CPdf provides interface also for document revision handling done in XRefWriter
 * class. Actual revision number (the newest revision has the highest number and 
 * gets smaller towards the older revisions with the 0 used for the oldest one) 
 * can be obtained by getActualRevision method. Current revision can be changed 
 * by changeRevision method. As a result, just objects included until the current 
 * revisions are available. Also no changes can be done if revision is not the 
 * newest one, because PDF document doesn't support revision branching. 
 * All these operations are just delegated (after som checks) to XRefWriter.
 * <br>
 * All internal data structures which may depend on current revision are
 * intialized and cleaned up in initRevisionSpecific method.
 * <br>
 * Note that linearized documents brings some restrictions and so no revision
 * changing is supported by XRefWriter.
 * @see XRefWriter 
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Document saving</b><br>
 * Actual changes can be saved by save method. This works in two modes depending
 * on given parameter. One creates new revision with changes, which
 * means swithces to this revision whereas second approach saves changes to the
 * end of file and doesn't change revision. Both of apporoaches have their pros
 * and cons. Basicaly, new revision should be used if changes are ended and
 * saving with no revision should be used if we want to temporarily store
 * changes to prevent data lost by program crash or whatever problem.
 * @see save(bool).
 * 
 * Different way of page content storing is so called document clonig done by
 * clone method. This method stores document content up to current revision. This
 * enables to make snapshot of document of arbitrary revision to separate
 * document and this document (as it has that revision as the newest one)
 * enables making changes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation notes and limitations</b><br>
 * This version of CPdf and all its components doesn't support linearized pdf
 * files very well. Revision handling and all related, are not prepared for
 * special format and objects deployed for such documents.
 * <br>
 * Each instance cotains unique identificator which is returned by getId 
 * method.

 * <p>
 * <b>Pdf standard notes</b>:
 * <br>
 * Pdf tree structure contains of two types of page dictionaries. 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pages dictionary - which is just intermediate node in the tree and
 * contains children nodes. These may be direct pages or another Pages node.
 * It doesn't represent page itself. All children are stored in Kids array.
 * Dictionary also contains Count information which holds number of all
 * Page dictionaries under this node.
 * <li>Page dictionary - leaf node which represents direct page.
 * </ul>
 * This structure is rather complex but enables effective way to access 
 * arbitrary page in short time (some applications provide balanced tree form
 * to enable very effective access).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation notes</b>:<br>
 * Function tries to find page also in page tree structure which doesn't follow
 * pdf specification. All wierd page tree elements are ignored and just those
 * which may stand for intermediate or leaf nodes are condidered. Also doesn't
 * use Count or Parent field information during searching. Uses getKidsCount
 * function to get intermediate leaf nodes count. getKidsCount method requieres 
 * also cache which stores already known nodes to their counts mapping. This 
 * function just delegates given cache parameter to getPageCount and doesn't 
 * care for it much more. If it is NULL, it is not used.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage notes</b>:<br>
 * If searching from begining, page tree root should be used as pagesDict
 * parameter and startPos set to 1.
 * <pre>
 * Example:
 * shared_ptr<CDict> pageTreeRoot=getPageTreeRoot(pdf);
 * if(pageTreeRoot.get())
 * 	findPageDict(pdf, pageTreeRoot, 1, posToSearch, NULL);
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * Searching can start also from different intermediate node than root, but 
 * startPos has to be correct position of this node in the tree (same value 
 * as returned by getNodePosition method applied on such node). This usage can
 * be used for searching optimization when just part of the tree is searched.
 *
 * @throw PageNotFoundException if given position couldn't be found under
 * subtree defined by pagesDict.
 * @throw ElementBadTypeException if pagesDict is not dictionary or reference to
 * dictionary.
 * @return Dereferenced page (wrapped in shared_ptr) dictionary at given
